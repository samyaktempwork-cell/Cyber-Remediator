# Cyber-Remediator
Cyber Remediator (Public Interface) and Aegis Vizier Protocol (Internal Orchestrator) provide an end-to-end solution. It doesn't just scan for leaks; it executes the recovery. By combining LLM-powered reasoning (Gemini 2.5) with enterprise-grade workflow orchestration (Kestra), we've built a "Final Mile" platform for digital identity protection.
